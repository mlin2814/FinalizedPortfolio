# FinalizedPortfolio

My live portfolio that gives you information about myself and my work. The works that I have done or contributed to have live links for you to try out yourself. The 'Bamazon' link is to the repo because it is a commandline based application. The 'EDC Manager' application is still under development and will be updated as progress is made. I hope you find this informative and my color palette interesting.
